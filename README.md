![Alt text](https://memgraph.com/images/blog/develop-smarter-by-uncovering-insights-inside-data-streams-memgraph-cloud-lab/cloud-release-blog-post-2.png)

## Overview

This project aims to provide Jay-Zz Entertainment with a comprehensive solution for real-time analysis and recommendations based on movie critiques. The system is designed to stream and process movie critique data using Kafka, transform and store it in Memgraph, and enable efficient real-time analysis using Cypher queries. The development environment is containerized using Docker and Docker Compose for seamless deployment.

## Installation and Configuration

- Set up the development environment using Docker and Docker Compose.
- Install Memgraph Lab for visualization and Cypher query execution.

## Integration and Configuration of Kafka

- Configure Kafka for streaming movie critique data.
- Create necessary Kafka topics and ensure proper integration.

## Development of the Transformation Module

- Design and implement a Python module to transform Kafka messages into a format compatible with Memgraph.

## Data Processing with Memgraph

- Configure Memgraph for processing Kafka data streams.
- Create a graph database tailored to the movie critique data model.

## Analysis and Cypher Queries

- Develop Cypher queries for real-time data analysis and movie recommendations.
- Optimize queries for high performance.

## GDPR Compliance and Data Governance

- Ensure system compliance with GDPR, focusing on user consent and personal data protection.
- Implement data governance policies for data quality, security, and integrity.
- Develop and maintain a detailed data catalog for traceability and understanding of data sources.

## Data Input Format

The input data should be modeled in the following format:

```json
{"userId": "365", "movie": { "movieId": "7526", "title": "Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The (2001)", "genres": ["Adventure", "Fantasy"] }, "rating": "5", "timestamp": "45554125" }
